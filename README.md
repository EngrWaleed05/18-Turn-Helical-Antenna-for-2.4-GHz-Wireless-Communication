# 18-Turn Helical Antenna for 2.4 GHz Wireless Communication

This repository contains the design and simulation of an **18-Turn Helical Antenna** operating in **axial mode at 2.4 GHz**.  
The antenna achieves **high gain (17–18.8 dBi)** with a **narrow 26° beamwidth**, making it suitable for long-range directional communication.
